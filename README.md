## Introduction

The **Palisade Identity JavaScript SDK** provides a set of tools and methods to streamline the implementation of authentication, secure wallet creation (via MPC), transaction signing, transaction submission and passkey secured approval in your JavaScript applications.

## Browser Requirements

The **Palisade Identity JavaScript SDK** makes use of modern browser API's including:

- [Credential API](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_credential)
- [Window API](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_open)

## Features

- User authentication (login, logout, session management)
- User registration and wallet creation using MPC
- Secure API requests with token-based authentication
- Easy integration with JavaScript/TypeScript applications

## Installation

Install the SDK via npm:

```bash
npm install @palisadeinc/identity-sdk
```

or via yarn:

```bash
yarn add @palisadeinc/identity-sdk
```

### Module Support

The SDK supports both CommonJS and ES Module formats:

**ES Modules (ESM):**

```javascript
import { PalisadeIdentitySDK } from '@palisadeinc/identity-sdk';
```

**CommonJS (CJS):**

```javascript
const { PalisadeIdentitySDK } = require('@palisadeinc/identity-sdk');
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with the Palisade Identity SDK:

```javascript
import { PalisadeIdentitySDK } from '@palisadeinc/identity-sdk';

// Initialize the SDK
const palisade = new PalisadeIdentitySDK({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  iconUrl: 'https://placehold.co/40x40'
});

// Call the connect method to initiate the create wallet / login flow
palisade.connect();
```

## Usage

### Initializing the SDK

Before using any SDK functions, you must initialize it with your configuration:

```javascript
import { PalisadeIdentitySDK } from '@palisadeinc/identity-sdk';

const palisade = new PalisadeIdentitySDK({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  iconUrl: 'https://placehold.co/40x40'
});

// User creates or connects their Palisade wallet
palisade.on('connected', () => {});

// User disconnects their Palisade wallet
palisade.on('disconnected', () => {});

// Error handling for both SDK level errors and service errors
palisade.on('error', (errorObj) => {
  console.log(errorObj.level, errorObj.code, errorObj.description);
});

// User approves a transaction
palisade.on('transaction-approved', (data) => {
  console.log(data.signature, data.id, data.encodedTransaction);
});

// User rejects a transaction
palisade.on('transaction-rejected', () => {});

// Transaction fails due to technical issues
palisade.on('transaction-failed', (data) => {
  console.log(
    `Transaction failed: ${data.transactionId}, Status: ${data.transactionStatus}`
  );
  console.log(`Reasons: ${data.reasons.join(', ')}`);
});
```

  console.log('Transaction ID:', data.id);
  console.log('Encoded Transaction:', data.encodedTransaction);
});
```

<a id="transaction-rejected"></a>

### Event: `transaction-rejected`

This event is triggered when a user rejects a transaction. It does not provide any additional data, as it simply indicates the rejection action.

#### Usage

To handle the `transaction-rejected` event, you need to subscribe to it using the `palisade.on` method. Here's an example of how to do it:

```javascript
palisade.on('transaction-rejected', () => {
  console.log('Transaction was rejected by the user.');
});
```

<a id="transaction-failed"></a>

### Event: `transaction-failed`

This event is triggered when a transaction fails. It provides detailed error information to help developers diagnose and handle the failure appropriately.

#### Event Data Structure

The event handler receives a data object with the following properties:

- **reasons**: `array` - An array of failure reasons or error messages explaining what went wrong.
- **transactionId**: `string` - The unique identifier of the transaction that failed.
- **transactionStatus**: `string` - The status of the transaction at the time of failure.

#### Example

To handle the `transaction-failed` event, you need to subscribe to it using the `palisade.on` method. Here's an example of how to do it:

```javascript
palisade.on('transaction-failed', (data) => {
  console.log('Transaction ID:', data.transactionId);
  console.log('Failure Reasons:', data.reasons);
});
```

```

### TypeScript Support

For TypeScript users, error codes are available as an enum with comprehensive error information:

```typescript
// ESM
import {
  PalisadeIdentitySDK,
  ErrorCode,
  ErrorInfo,
  ERROR_INFO
} from '@palisadeinc/identity-sdk';

// Or CJS
// const {
//   PalisadeIdentitySDK,
//   ErrorCode,
//   ErrorInfo,
//   ERROR_INFO
// } = require('@palisadeinc/identity-sdk');

const palisade = new PalisadeIdentitySDK({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
});

palisade.on('error', (errorObj: ErrorInfo) => {
  // Access error information programmatically
  const errorInfo = ERROR_INFO[errorObj.code as ErrorCode];

  if (errorInfo) {
    console.log(`Title: ${errorInfo.title}`);
    console.log(`Description: ${errorInfo.description}`);
    console.log(`Level: ${errorInfo.level}`);
  }

  // Handle specific errors with enum values
  switch (errorObj.code) {
    case ErrorCode.NOT_CONNECTED:
      palisade.connect();
      break;
    case ErrorCode.JWT_NOT_AUTHENTICATED:
      palisade.connect();
      break;
    case ErrorCode.BROWSER_NOT_SUPPORTED:
